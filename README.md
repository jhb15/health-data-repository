# Objectives
* API endpoints to accept data in a standardised (yet to be decided) format
* Ability to fetch health data for 1 or more users
* Ability to perform sort / range / limit operations when requesting data
* Ability to delete data 
* Logging and auditing


# Thoughts
* Possibly NoSQL due to semi-structured data?
